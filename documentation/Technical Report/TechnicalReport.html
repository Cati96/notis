    <h2><span>1. </span>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        In this report we have highlighted the stages of the current project development, its description, the
        technologies used and the challenges encountered. Finally, we presented some conclusions and future improvements
        for our application.

    <h2><span>2. </span>Introduction and objectives</h2>
    <p>
        Notis is a web application that offers the possibility to search for different entities as notaries and
        translators based on different searching criterias such as: proximity, type of documents that can be released,
        etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application offer real-time locations on map (provided by Google Maps) on which we can indentify the user
        location or actual positions of the offices and estimates the time needed to travel to the desired destination
        using different types of transport (personal vehicle, bicycle, public transport, walking).
    </p>
    <p>
        For each type of entity we display informations regarding the documents that can be released, their prices and
        general contact informations such as: telephone number and email address. Also, we can check which are the
        additional documents we need to provide and we can download templates for them in order to complete them and to
        not waste any precious time.
    </p>

<section id="application-architecture">
    <h2><span>3. </span>Application Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        Application architecture is separated in two main components consisting of: the server application and the
        client application. In the image below we can visualize the main architecture.
    </p>
    <img id="architecture-img" src="../UML/arhitecture.png" alt="architecture"/>
    <p>Communication between server and client is made via HTTP requests.</p>
    <section id="server">
        <h3><span>3.1 </span>Server</h3>
        <p> The server application is written in Java. In Java we do all the processing that the application requires.
            Regarding technologies we are using: Spring Boot, Maven and Apache Jena.</p>
        <p>For a better structure of a code, as design pattern we use MVCS pattern where we split the code in four main
            parts: </p>
        <p>Finally, in order to can use our back-end application, we are deploying it in Apache Tomcat container.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>M-Model: represents an POJO object which is carrying data (gets/sets data)</li>
            <li>V-View: represents the visualization of the data that model contains; we are skipping that part</li>
            <li>C-Controller: the one who exposes the data; connects the service with the model, acting as a bridge</li>
            <li>S-Service: encapsulates the business logic, letting the Model clean</li>
        </ul>
        <section id="maven">
            <h4><span>3.1.1 </span>Maven</h4>
            <p>Maven is used in order to resolve all imports of dependecies required for the project.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="tomcat">
            <h4><span>3.1.2 </span>Tomcat</h4>
            <p>Apache Tomcat is an open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression
                Language and WebSocket technologies.</p>
            <p>Tomcat provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java based web applications can
                run.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="spring-boot">
            <h4><span>3.1.3 </span>Spring Boot</h4>
            <p>Spring Boot is used to accelerate and facilitate back-end application development. With the help of
                Spring we create a microservice which helps in processing of data necessary for client, through
                endpoints. There is an OpenAPI document that contains the main endpoints offered by our server can be
                found <a href="./openApi.html">here</a>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="apache-jena">
            <h4><span>3.1.4 </span>Apache Jena</h4>
            <p>We made use of Apache Jena framework to manipulate the RDF model and to interogate it via SPARQL. The RDF
                structure will be described in the next chapter.</p>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section id="client">
        <h3><span>3.2 </span>Client</h3>
        <p>The client web application is developed using Angular framework and runs on a NodeJS server.
        </p>
        <p>In order to use a proper map on which the users can see the actual position of different offices across the
            country we made use of OpenStreetMap API. The official documentation of this API can be consulted <a
                    href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6">here</a>.
        </p>

            <h4><span>3.2.1 </span>Angular</h4>
            <p>Angular is a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications, based ob TypeScript language.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="nodejs">
            <h4><span>3.2.2 </span>NodeJS</h4>
            <p>NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. NodeJS
                lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts
                server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. </p>

<section id="rdf-structure">
    <h2><span>4. </span>RDF structure</h2>
    <p>RDF was generated using rdflib Python library. Data was provided in two excel documents and a Python script was
        used to filter the data, add missing information and to create a rdf document in the rdf/XML format.
    </p>
    <p>The rdf contains two types of entities: Notary and Translator. Both entities are of type person. Their structure
        are very similar, only some minor differences are present. We can check the syntax for both entities below.

    <p>As we can see both entities have a similar structure, the only difference being the <b>languages</b> tag that is
        applying only for translators. This structure will suffer changes in the future, different types of document
        templates will be added and the prices for each service that is offered by an entity.
    </p>
    <p>Different types of RDFs can be generated using the <b>rdflib</b> library such as:‘xml’, ‘n3’, ‘turtle’, ‘nt’,
        ‘pretty-xml’, ‘trix’, ‘trig’. The current format is pretty-xml.</p>
</section>
<section id="sparql-queries">
    <h2><span>5. </span>Interesting SPARQL Queries</h2>
</section>
<section id="requirements">
    <h2><span>6. </span>Initial goals & Requirements</h2>
    <p>Our application starts from the premise that there are people who want to find out multiple information about
        notary officials from their country.</p>
    <p>So, we established a couple of goals/requirements to follow in order to satisfy the end-users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To can list all notaries and translators along with their base information like authorization number,
            address, timetable
        </li>
        <li>For each official to display all services offered with their price and with all draft documents for each
            service
        </li>
        <li>To search for notaries or translators in area of user's current location, or by selecting a custom
            location
        </li>
        <li>Finally, from the end-user perspective to can search entities by their services offered</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a plus, to make our life easier, to can have an administrative console where we can manipulate all the
        notaries and translators.</p>
</section>
<section id="results">
    <h2><span>7. </span>Results</h2>
    <p>In the end, our application satisfies our initial requirements, so everybody can search for notary officials in
        order to find what kind of services they offer, which is their timetable, how they can be contacted and where
        they can be found.</p>
    <p>More that this, we have a web administrative console, where just a few people can have access and in which we can
        add, remove or modify translators and notaries along with their information about services, documents, timetable
        and address. </p>
</section>
<section id="challanges">
    <h2><span>8. </span>Challenges encountered</h2>
    <p>One of our biggest challenge was to create the RDF model and to fill with the existent data about notary
        officials.</p>
    <p>More than this, another difficulty was to manipulate the data inside the RDF, because we never worked with this
        kind of data modeling and interrogation.</p>
    <p>Another challenge that we had was to work with the maps. Initially we started to work with GoogleMaps APIs and it
        seemed okay to work with this API until we wasn't able to use one of their feature because an amount of money
        was necessary
        to buy a key required for the API. So we had to change out maps API provider from Google Maps to something else.
        We tried multiple API providers after that until we found the OpenStreetMap API which was our lifeline. </p>
    <p>We need some time to figure it out how the OSM API works, how we can work with the map container, overlayers,
        features, markers
        and other things, how to destroy in a good way, how to recreate them and so on.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
    <h2><span>9. </span>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To sum up, we think that we successfully accomplished our initial requirements so the end-users can benefit from
        our application if they want to find out more information about legalized notaries and translators.</p>
    <p>For us, as a team, but not only, for us as individuals, we taught something really new, working with RDFs and
        SPARQL and another thing, how to implement a map container which has multiple features.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-improvements">
    <h2><span>10. </span>Future improvements</h2>
    In the future we can add some new features like:
    <ul>
        <li>Adding for user possibility to add review and rating to one entity (notary/translator)</li>
        <li>To offer more search criteria</li>
        <li>To add on the maps possibility to see the best way to arrive to the entity's office with multiple
            transportation modes.
        </li>
    </ul>
