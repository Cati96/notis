    <h2><span>1. </span>User guide</h2>
    <p>From the main screen shown in the image bellow we can select what type of user we want to use.</p>
    <p>
        The admin user has the right to modify entities such that: notaries, translators, addresses, services, etc.</p>
    <p>Normal users can only view and search entities based on location and type of services that they offer.</p>

    <section id="user">
        <h3><span>1.1 </span>User</h3>
        <p>Users can see three main tabs in the navigation bar: <b>Notaries</b>, <b>Translators</b> and <b>Search with
            filters</b>. The first two tabs are very similar.</p>
        <p>When accessing the Notaries tab, first thing that we will see will be all the notaries that are present in
            our database.</p>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/norati_main.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <p>We are able to see the name, the authorisation number and the phone number. By clicking on <b>See details</b>
            button under <b>Addresses</b>, <b>Timetable</b> or <b>Services</b> we will be able to check extra
            information that will appear in a new modal.</p>
        <p>In image below we can see the modal in which the address is displayed. In the left side we can see the
            address details and on the right side a map on which the position is displayed using a marker. We have the
            possibility to zoom in or out the map.</p>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/notary_address.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <p>The <b>Timetable</b> tab will open a new modal in which we can check the working hours of the entity
            separated by days.</p>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/notary_timetable.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <p>In order to see the services offered by each entity we can click on <b>See details</b> button situated on the
            <b>Services</b> column. The type of service and a short description will be visible on our screen. Here we
            can see also the document available for each service and also we can download templates by clicking on the
            <b>Download</b> button.</p>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/notary_service.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/notary_documents.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <p>The <b>Translator</b> tab is very similar, the only difference is that notaries have also information about
            the languages.</p>
        <p>In <b>Search by filters</b> tab we can search entities based on their location or by the type of services
            that they offer.</p>
        <p>The first step is to select what type of entities we want to search for. Here we have two options: Notaries
            and Translators. Next we will need to select the criteria by which we will search.</p>
        <p>When we try to searh by the service offered a list of services will appear on the screen. We can select the
            services by clicking on the box from the left of the service name. After clicking on <b>Search</b> button a
            map will appear and we will be able to see the position of all the entities that respect our searching
            criteria.</p>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/notary_search_by_service.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/notary_search_by_service_2.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <p>Another option is to search by the current location or by a custom location. For the second case we need to
            complete a form with the desired address.</p>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/search_by_location.png" alt="architecture"/>
    </section>
    <section id="admin">
        <h3><span>1.2 </span>Admin</h3>
        <p>The admin have the possibility to edit the information from the rdf and also to add new information. The
            interface is very similar with the interface for the normal user but we have extra buttons for create, edit
            and delete.</p>
        <p>Below we have the main screen for notaries. We can see that a button for edit and delete is present for each
            notary. The plus sign from the upper-right corner is used to create a new notary.</p>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/admin_main.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <p>When we want to update an entity we can click on the <b>Edit</b> button and a modal in which we can change
            the name, the authorisation number, the phone number and the languages(only for translators).</p>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/update_translator.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <p>We can change also the address and the timetable for each entity by following the same steps.</p>
        <p>In order to create or to edit services we can expand the service tab and we will be able to see all the
            services under a certain entity. Here we have the same buttons for create, edit and delete.</p>
        <img class="user-guide-imgs" src="./user_guide_img/update_service.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <p>From this page we can also access the documents for each service. Here we have also the possibility to
            create, edit or remove a document.</p>
